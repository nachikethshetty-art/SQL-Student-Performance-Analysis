# SQL-Student-Performance-Analysis
SQL Student Performance Analysis A SQL project that extends a student management database by adding courses and enrollments tables, and performs analytical queries using joins, aggregations, and filtering to evaluate student performance.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of a SQL Data Analysis Internship task. The objective is to extend a basic student management database by adding course and enrollment information, and then analyze student performance using SQL queries.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- MySQL
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Group By)

## 🗂 Database Structure
- **students** (id, name, age, department)
- **courses** (id, name)
- **enrollments** (student_id, course_id, grade)

## 📊 Key SQL Queries
- List all students enrolled in each course
- Calculate the average grade per course
- Identify the top 3 students based on overall performance
- Count the number of students who failed (grade < 40)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding relational database design
- Using JOIN operations to combine multiple tables
- Applying aggregate functions like AVG and COUNT
- Performing analytical queries to extract insights

> Note: Sample data was used to demonstrate SQL concepts and analysis.

## 📁 Files Included
- SQL script for table creation
- SQL script for data insertion
- SQL queries for analysis

## ✅ Status
Completed and tested using MySQL.
